Lesson 7 : Assignment
=====================

In this lesson's assignment we are going to apply techniques beyond
vertical scaling (upgrading servers) to help maximize application performance.

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Write functions to add and update customer and products to your HP
   Norton database in parallel. You module should launch the updates to
   both database simultaneously.
#. Compare and contrast parallel vs. linear performance by providing
   actual data at applicable locations in your module.
#. Create and provide an example of where the program fails due to contention and explain
   why in code comments.
#. Provide an example that works, with tests that pass.
