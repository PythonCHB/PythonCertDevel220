Part 6: More about mongodb
#########################

Here's some more information you can read to learn more before we start
the mongodb activites.

Activities
----------
#. Having thought about the ideas for improving the MongoDB module from the video,
   first of all work through imlementing your ideas. Be prepared to dicuss or
   demonstrate these at office hours, or with your instructor.

Optional
--------
#. MongoDB is not the only NoSQL database in town. There are many others.
   Of particular interest to Python developers are Redis, and Neo4J. They
   offer very useful features, and are well documented.
   Invetsigate their documentation, and try downloading and using either or both
   for situations where you think they offer functionality that is useful
   fro HP Norton. Again, feel free to bring along your results to dicuss or
   demonstrate at office hours, or with your instructor.
   And check out the example we provided in the class repo.
