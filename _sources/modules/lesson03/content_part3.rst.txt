Part 3: Reading and writing data
################################

Now we have looked at the model, lets look at how we create, read, and
delete data from the database, using the Person class. Here we use the
following
code: `v3\_p1\_populate\_db.py <https://github.com/milesak60/RDBMS/blob/master/src/v3_p1_populate_db.py>`__,
then \ `v3\_p1\_populate\_db.py <https://github.com/milesak60/RDBMS/blob/master/src/v3_p1_populate_db.py>`__ and
finally \ `v3\_p3\_add\_and\_delete.py <https://github.com/milesak60/RDBMS/blob/master/src/v3_p3_add_and_delete.py>`__.

We'll illustrate this by working with the Job class. He we will use all
the Python modules for the repository that start with v4:
