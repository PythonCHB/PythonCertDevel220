Lesson 3 : Assignment
=====================

In this lesson's assignment we are going to store customer data for HP
Norton in a relational database (sqlite3). We are also going to amend our
functional tests (or create new ones) so that we can verify the customer
data meets HP Norton's needs.

You should address the following requirements:
#. As a salesperson at HP Norton I need to be able to store details of
   customers so that I can manage how I contact them to sell furniture.
#. As an accountant at HP Norton I need to be able to store and retrieve
   customers credit limits.
#. As a manager at HP Norton I need to be able to produce monthly counts of
   the total number of active customers so that I can assess of the business is
   growing or shrinking.

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Create a customer model and database that can be used at HPNorton. Note:
   we are just developing the backend. Imagine your module(s) will be called
   from a web app (that is outside the scope of this class).
#. Create some functional and unit tests for the model.
#. Develop functionality to deliver the requirements listed above.
#. Develop tests, and show some tests passing. Show other tests failing.


Tips
----
- Remember to think about system features, not web pages or the UI.
- Tests first!
- Be creative! Think about what the furniture store might need.
- Make sure the tests run.
