At some point, hopefully fairly early in your Python development career
you will need to release the results of your efforts to production.
This is where packagin comes in.

To understand packaging, it really is essential to understand how packages 
and modules relate to each other and are used, and also to understand how 
```import``` finds modules (always challenging for beginners).

Here is some readng that will build on your current knowledge, and help
promote your understanding.
