.. todo::
    Make this assignment consistent with the case study.
    
In this lesson's assignment we are going to apply techniques to identify the
right way to find bottlenecks in modules. We will use an evidence
based approach to making the right improvements

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Take an instructor provided module and identify the bottlenecks.
#. Rewrite the module to improve performance. Provide evidence to demonstrate
   the improvement.
#. Assess and compare the performance of adding 100 records to the product and
   customer databases, and reading 100 records from these databases.


Tips
----
- Amend some of the previously provided data to create the 100 records
