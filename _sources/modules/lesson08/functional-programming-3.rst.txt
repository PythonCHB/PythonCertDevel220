Functional Techniques
#####################

Introduction
============

In this third lesson on functional programming, we will follow a string of
related techniques. First, we will look at closures and compare them to
classes and objects and thereby bridge the gap between functional
programming and object oriented programming. We will then see how closures
form the basis of function currying, and in turn how function currying
facilitates functional composition.

We wrap up our series of functional programming lessons with an overview
of the Itertools and Functools libraries which facilitate the techniques
covered across all three lessons.

Recommended Text
================

For the functional programming modules, this lesson included, we
recommend `Functional Python Programming by Steven
Lott.

Learning Objectives
===================
Upon successful completion of this lesson, you will be able to:

\* define a closure as a factory for creating stand-alone methods.
\* describe the arity of a function.
\* curry a function to reduce its arity, its number of arguments in
   particular, and thereby make it suitable for functional composition.
\* use the Itertools library.
\* use the Functools library.
