#. Provide the steps (in order) of Test Driven Development (TDD). There may 
or may not be a fifth step to TDD. If there is not, then select "There is no
fifth step." for step five.

First
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Second
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Third
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Fourth
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Fifth
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

In TDD, you write the feature or code after  you write the test for that
code.
