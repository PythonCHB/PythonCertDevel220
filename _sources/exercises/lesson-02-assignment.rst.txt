Last week we looked at Spotify’s top tracks from 2017. We used
comprehensions and perhaps a lambda to find tracks we might like. Having
recovered from last week’s adventure in pop music we’re ready to venture
back.

**Write a generator to find and print all of your favorite artist’s
tracks from the data set.** Your favorite artist isn’t represented in
that set? In that case, find Ed Sheeran’s tracks.

**Load the data set following the instructions from last week. Submit
your generator expression and the titles of Ed’s tracks.**

**Using the same data set, write a closure to capture high energy
tracks.** We will define high energy tracks as anything over 8.0. Submit
your code and the tracks it finds, artist name, track name and energy
value.
