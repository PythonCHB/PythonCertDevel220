.. rubric:: Textbooks
   :name: textbooks
   :class: caH3

You are not required to buy any textbooks for this course. We have
determined over time that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work
well for the diverse skills and backgrounds of our students. Thus,
rather than requiring that everyone purchase a single text, \ `we supply
many
resources, <https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/references/learning.html>`__ \ most
of which are free and available online. 

| For the functional programming modules, we recommend the
  text \ `Functional Python Programming by Steven
  Lott. <https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/functional-python-programming>`__ This
  text will be used for Optional Reading:
| Publisher: Packt Publishing
| Pub. Date: January 31, 2015
| Web ISBN-13: 978-1-78439-761-6
| Print ISBN-13: 978-1-78439-699-2
| ***Note: a second edition is out here: ***

This program uses \ `GitHub  <https://github.com/>`__\ to share code and
class resources, and you will complete your assignments by committing
your work to a \ `GitHub
repository <https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassRepos>`__.

| All of the work that you commit to GitHub will be publicly visible.
  Some students will appreciate associating this work with their public
  persona, demonstrating their classwork as a kind of portfolio.
| Other students may prefer not to connect learning materials or
  coursework with their public persona. If you would prefer NOT to be
  publicly associated with the work that you perform in this course,
  then we encourage you to use an alias other than your legal name or
  normal online username for the GitHub account that you use for this
  course: you do NOT need to associate your real name or regularly used
  online username with your GitHub account.
| If you begin the course using a GitHub account attached to your name,
  you may switch to using a pseudonymous account at any time; just be
  sure to inform your instructional team.
