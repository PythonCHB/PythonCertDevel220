This course continues where the first course ("Programming with Python")
left off, building upon and beyond the basics. During these 10 weeks,
students will expand their toolbox and techniques (decorators,
generators) and exploration of the Python ecosystem, learn best
practices for testing and debugging, and explore system development and
deployment. In addition, students will use Python to interact with
variety of databases and learn a bit of SQL and NoSQL. The course will
end with a focus on performance issues (PyPy, Cython, Profiling).
