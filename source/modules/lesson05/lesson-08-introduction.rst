Introduction
============

Having studied relational databases in the last lesson, we are now going
to move on to look at other types of databases. 

The range of products we can study here is enormous, so we will pick
three of the most popular, each of which has its own strengths and
applicability. We will discuss and build some simple programs to get you
started. Much further study will be needed to really grasp the concepts
and use these databases effectively, so we will point you to some
additional resources.

Learning Objectives
===================

Upon successful completion of this lesson, you will be able to:

-  Compare and contrast some different types of modern database
   products.
-  Select a database product based on a solid understanding of where
   that database is best used.
-  Write Python programs that illustrate the way in which these
   databases can be used.
-  Find additional information that will help you to build data centric
   Python applications.

New Words, Concepts, and Tools
==============================

-  We are going to learn about graph databases, data structure servers
   and document centric databases. We will also cover some simple but
   effective data storage techniques that are available in Python.
