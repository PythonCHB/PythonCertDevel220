Lesson 5 : Assignment
=====================

In this lesson's assignment we are going to learn how to apply the mongodb
API while exploiting mongodb's ability to allow the Python module, not the
database, to specify the schema for the data to be stored.

You will use an instructor-provided product file in csv format.

You should address the following requirements:
#.  As a HP Norton customer I want to see a list of all products available for
    rent so that I can make a rental choice.
#. As a HP Norton salesperson I want to see a list of all of the different
   types of a product, showing a product number, name, product type and
   description.
#. As a HP Norton salesperson I want to see a list of the name and contact
   details of all customers who have rented products, and the name, description
   and type of the product that they rented.

.. todo::
    Create product CSV file (Andy)


Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Create a product database with attributes that reflect the ocntent ofthe
   csv file.
#. Write queries to retrieve the product data
#. Write a query to integrate customer and product data
#. Update tests to show the data is being maintained correctly in the database.
