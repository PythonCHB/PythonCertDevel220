Lesson 1 : Assignment
=====================

In this lesson's assignment we are going to prepare for developing the
functionality needed for the case study. We will be using a test driven
approach to developing a new system for HP Norton, so this week we will
prepare a first set of tests that describe the functionality that is needed.

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Read or reread the background to the case study.
#. List the key features of a system that you believe will address HP Nortonâ€™s
   needs.
#. Write around half a dozen functional tests for the case study that will
   verify of the key features you have identified operate in line with HP
   Norton's needs.

Tips
----
Think about system features, not web pages or the UI. For example, if we
were building a banking system a feature might be:

- Accept customer withdrawls providing their overdraft limit is not
  exceeded.
- Be creative! Think about what the furniture store might need.
- Make sure the tests run.
- Right now the test will all fail. That's the idea!

During the class you will develop these or similar features. Then you will
 see your tests start to pass.
