Using automated tests to confirm the functioning of your code is not the
only way to manage the complexity of a large code base. There are also
tools which can automatically report on how readable your code is and
how well it follows the conventions of Python programming: flake and
lint.

These tools can help ensure that your code is readable and maintainable
by other programmers.
