Spend time using any of the modules or techniques referenced in this
Lesson. Of particular interest (choose one to submit):

-  Explore code-only performance improvement strategies such as
   memoization.
-  Explore/demo cProfile side by side with PyCharm’s built-in profilers.
-  Explore/demo Python’s
   memory\_profiler. \ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler
-  Use PyPy as the runtime interpreter for code developed by students
   during the curriculum.
-  Play with Cython and the Great Circle code!
-  Abandon Python’s math library and use \ ``cdef extern``\  to import
   and access C math functions into the Python code. (This vastly
   improves the performance of the Great Circle code!)
-  Dig into the compile and link steps required by Cython.
-  Work with setup files or any of the other methods to generate cython
   libraries.\ http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/build.html
-  Work with Cython
   profiling. \ http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/profiling_tutorial.html
-  Create a Makefile to manage the build (compile/link steps) for all
   the Cython code you’re
   generating. \ https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

Once you've completed the activity from the lesson content, commit your
changes and submit:

-  a link to your repository on GitHub
-  the relevant .py file(s)

We'll be grading this activity purely on the percentage of included
tests that pass.

Submitting Your Work 
=====================

Put the file(s) (ex: a\_new\_file.py) in your student directory in a new
subdirectory named for this lesson, and add it to your clone early (git
add a\_new\_file.py). Make frequent commits with good, clear messages
about what you're doing and why.

When you're done and ready for the instructors to review your work, push
your changes to your GitHub fork (git push) and then go to the GitHub
website and make a pull request. Copy the link to the pull request.

Click the *Submit Assignment* button in the upper right.

**Part 1: File(s)**

Use the \ *Choose File* button to find and select the saved .py file or,
if there are multiple files for the assignment, the .zip file.

**Part 2: GitHub Link**

Paste the GitHub link to the pull request in the comments area.

Click the \ *Submit Assignment* button.
