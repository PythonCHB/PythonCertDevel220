Spend time using any of the modules or techniques referenced in this
Lesson. Of particular interest (choose one to get ready to demo):

-  Explore code-only performance improvement strategies such as
   memoization.
-  Explore/demo cProfile side by side with PyCharm’s built-in profilers.
-  Explore/demo Python’s
   memory\_profiler. \ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler
-  Use PyPy as the runtime interpreter for code developed by students
   during the curriculum.
-  Play with Cython and the Great Circle code!
-  Abandon Python’s math library and use \ ``cdef extern``\  to import
   and access C math functions into the Python code. (This vastly
   improves the performance of the Great Circle code!)
-  Dig into the compile and link steps required by Cython.
-  Work with setup files or any of the other methods to generate cython
   libraries.\ http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/build.html
-  Work with Cython
   profiling. \ http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/profiling_tutorial.html
-  Create a Makefile to manage the build (compile/link steps) for all
   the Cython code you’re
   generating. \ https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

Once you've completed the activity from the lesson content, prepare to demo your work!
