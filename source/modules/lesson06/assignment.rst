In this lesson's assignment we are going to apply techniques to identify the
right way to find bottlenecks in modules. We will use an evidence
based approach to making the right improvements

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

1. The assignment repository for this lesson contains a file with 1 million records
   and a module that reads the file.
2. The module is badly written and probably can be made to run more quickly and
   efficiently.
3. You will look at the code and may immediately form a judgment about where
   performance can be improved. Do not be tempted to make immediate changes!
4. Be sure to use an evidence based approach, and show with data how you were able
   to make improvements.
5. Rewrite the module to improve performance. Provide evidence to demonstrate
   the improvement. 
6. Your new module should be called good_perf.py, and should use identical input
   and produce identical output to poor_perf.py

Other requirements:
-------------------
As always, you should ensure your code produces no errors or warnings from pylint.

Submission
----------
You will submit woyr good_perf.py file, along with notes on your findings, performance 
improvements, and notes on your approach.
