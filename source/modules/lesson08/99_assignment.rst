Lesson 8 : Assignment
=====================

In this lesson's assignment we are going to take FP to another level by
adjusting the thought process by which we design and engineer Python
solutions. We will also conduct some comparative performance analysis to
show how these techniques can help.


Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Write functions to add and update customer and products in parallel.
#. Compare and contrast parallel vs. linear performance.
#. Provide an example where the program fails due to contention and explain
   why.
#. Provide an example with test that passes.
