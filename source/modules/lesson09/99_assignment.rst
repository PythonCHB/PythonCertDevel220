Lesson 9 : Assignment
=====================

In this lesson's assignment we are going to learn powerful and succinct
language features like decorators, context managers and recursion that can
help to build expressive programs that are easy to understand.

    More needed on lesson 9 assignment
    Need example for rework to recursion

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

#. Add decorators to introduce conditional logging in decorated classes
   (changing a single config variable in the module then turns logging on or
   off)
#. Write a context manager to be used to access mongodb.
#. Using an instructor provided module, rewrite that module to solve the
   problem using recursion.
