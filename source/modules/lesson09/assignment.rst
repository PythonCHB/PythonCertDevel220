Lesson 9 : Assignment
#####################

In this lesson's assignment we are going to apply language features 
like decorators, context managers and recursion that can
help to build expressive programs that are easy to understand.


.. todo::
    Need example for rework to recursion in lesson 9 assignment (Andy)

Here is what you need to do:
----------------------------

1. Add decorators to introduce conditional logging in decorated classes
   (changing a single config variable in the module then turns logging on or
   off)
2. Write a context manager to be used to access MongoDB. There is already
   and example in lesson 5, but build on this example. Try to add useful
   features based on your experience.
3. Using an instructor provided module, rewrite that module to solve the
   problem using recursion.
