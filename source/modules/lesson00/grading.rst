Grading
=======

The purpose of grading is to help students and instructors assess a students
progress on the class, and to demonstrate that a student is proficient and
achieved the class objectives.

There are three grades used to rate every assignment:

- Good: All aspects listed under both Minimum requirements as well as under
  "full requirements" for the assignment have been met.
- Satisfactory: all aspects listed under "minimum requirements" for the
  assignment have been met.
- Requires improvement: One or more aspects listed under "minimum
  requirements" for the assignment have not been met

Satisfactory is what a student should expect to achieve on the class.

The instructor provides student feedback and requests a resubmissioon
whenever thereâ€™s something missing.

For self-paced students, the instructor will grade the assignment as it is
and then provide an assessment override if and when the student submits a
new pull request for any missing elements.
