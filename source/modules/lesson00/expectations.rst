What does success on this class look like?
==========================================

For classroom, the usual 80% attendance is required. Contact your instructor as
soon as possible if you have any special circumstances that will prevent you from meeting this requirement.

For all class delivery methods you will need to achieve a pass rate of 80%
for the class assignments and quizzes. See the grading rubric for more details.

Also, most lessons include ungraded activities. This is work
that you can do to help you improved your understanding and apply the concepts learned. Although
ungraded, we expect that you will want to do the work!

Since giving demos is an important part of a modern devops toolset, your classroom
or online instructor will ask you to demo your work to the class (or to the instructor for
self paced classes). You will see references to where demos need to be prepared
in the lesson notes.

Aside from the formal grading on the class, particpation in all class
events and assignments is strongly encouraged. Particpation is the way you
will learn and are able to achieve your passing grade! And remember, learning
is not about getting everything right the first time. Try things, experiment,
make mistakes and we will help you become an advanced Python developer!
