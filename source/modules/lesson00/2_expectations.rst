==========================================

For classroom the usual 80% attendance is required. Contact your instructor as
soon as possible if you have any special circumstances.

For all class delivery methods you will need to achieve a pass rate of 80%
for the class assignments and quizzes. See the grading rubric at ...
for more details.

   Add link to grading rubric from Expectations (Andy).

Also, there are usually ungraded activities for the lessons. This is work
that you can do to help you really understand and apply the concepts. Although
the work is ungraded, we expect that you will want to do the work!

Since giving demos is an important part of a modern develops toolset, your classroom
or online instructor will ask you to demo your work to the class (or to the instructor for
self paced classes). You will see references to where demos need to be prepared
in the lesson notes.

Aside from the formal grading on the cllass, particpation in all class
events and assignments is strongly encouraged. Particpation is the way you
will learn and be able to achieve your passing grade! And remember, learning
is not about getting everything right first time. Try things, experiment,
make mistakes and we will help you to learn advanaced Python!
