=====

We want to make sure that every student understands how to get the most
from the Advanced Python Programming class.

This is a challenging class, in that we ocver a lot of concepts, some
of which can we hard to grasp. Please never be afraid to contact your
instructor with questions.

In a classroom setting we will give plenty of opportunity for interacting
with your follow students and for working on activities and assignments.
You will also be able to ask lots of questions, and there will be instructor
lead presentations to reinforce concepts.

Studets are encouraged to resent and discuss any of the code they are working
on, particularlry for the optional assignments.

For online group classes we will have office hopurs sessions every week,
which will have a similar agenda and content to classroom, but will be online
via Zoom

For self paced online classes you can always chat with your instructor, and
use the various online resources linked from the class web site.
