Guide
=====

We want to make sure that every student understands how to get the most
from the Advanced Python Programming class.

This is a challenging class, in that we cover a lot of concepts, some
of which can be hard to grasp at first. Please never hesitate to contact your
instructor with questions.

For those in a classroom setting, we will give plenty of opportunity for interacting
with your fellow students and for working on activities and assignments.
You will also be able to ask lots of questions, and there will be instructor-lead presentations to reinforce concepts.

Students are encouraged to resend and discuss any of the code they are working
on, particularly for the optional assignments.

For online group classes we will have office hours sessions every week,
which will have a similar agenda and content to classroom, but will be held online
via Zoom.

For self-paced online classes, you can always get in touch with your instructor, and
use the various online resources linked from the class web site.
