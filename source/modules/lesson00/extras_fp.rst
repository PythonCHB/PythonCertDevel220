Functional Programming
######################

Functional programming, or at least, the use of functional programming
techniques, has become quite common in Python.

In this course we will learn some of these techniques. And you may have heard about
them too, in the last lesson of the first course.

Here are some articles you may wish to read to help you become familiar
with the background to functional programming.

Don't think you need to learn or even understand this right now; this is just some background
material, knowledge of which will help you later in the class.
