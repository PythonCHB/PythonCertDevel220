Functional Programming
######################

Functional programming, or at least, the use of functional programming
techniques, has become quite ocmmon in Python. 

On this course we will learn some of these techniques. And you may have heard about
them too in the last lesson of the first course.

Here are some articles you may wish to read to help you become familiar
with the background to functional programming.

Dont think you need to lear or even understand this; this is just some background 
material, knowledge of which will help you later in the class.
