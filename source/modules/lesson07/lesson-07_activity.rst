Once you've completed the activity from the lesson content, commit your
changes and submit:

-  a link to your repository on GitHub
-  the relevant .py file(s)

We'll be grading this activity purely on the percentage of included
tests that pass.

Submitting Your Work 
=====================

Put the file(s) (ex: a\_new\_file.py) in your student directory in a new
subdirectory named for this lesson, and add it to your clone early (git
add a\_new\_file.py). Make frequent commits with good, clear messages
about what you're doing and why.

When you're done and ready for the instructors to review your work, push
your changes to your GitHub fork (git push) and then go to the GitHub
website and make a pull request. Copy the link to the pull request.

Click the *Submit Assignment* button in the upper right.
