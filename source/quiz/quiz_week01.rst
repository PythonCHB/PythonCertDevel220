#. The primary purpose of test driven development is to:
Avoid having to use testers when building systems
Ensure that no bugs make it to production
Define the expected behavior of code, and express that behavior
in a software script
Reduce development costs

#. Automated tests are most effective when built:
After software is complete
While software is being built
Prior to building any software

#. Provide the steps (in order) of Test Driven Development (TDD). There may 
or may not be a fifth step to TDD. If there is not, then select "There is no
fifth step." for step five.

First
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Second
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Third
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Fourth
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.

Fifth
Decide what feature or code you want to implement.
Write code to test whether or not the feature is working.
Run the test and see it fail.
Implement the feature or code.
Run the test and see it pass (hopefully!).
There is no fifth step.



#. Match each tool or concept with its purpose, use, or goal.
linting
Define a code style and automatically identify style violations.
Write code with no fixed dependencies.
Test a single region of code by providing dummies for any required classes
or instances.
Determine how much of your code is subject to automated tests.

dependency injection

or instances.
Determine how much of your code is subject to automated tests.

mock
